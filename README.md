## Safe@Home: Hayti Sham

## Quick Use
In order to run the app locally you need to have a running local Frontend in one 
terminal and a running local Backend in another terminal.
Currently we are using one DB (mongo) for prod and dev until we'll have a credit to have another one. (mongodb+srv://haytiSham_db:sDjE4PezjPl26wNs@cluster0.zzyhy.mongodb.net/haytiSham)

### Front-end development
1. Each UI change should be aligned with the [mock](https://www.figma.com/file/UcF9E1rT6rwKIQkkLD5EqN/hayiti_sham?node-id=446%3A286).
2. Each new string in the UI should be added to `lang-he.js` file and used with `react-18next` library.
    1. For example, search for `t('iHaveBeenThereHashtag')`.
3. Re-use existing strings from the `lang-he.js` file.
